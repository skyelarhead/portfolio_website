      <p>My experience with programming language was further honed in my college classes that were taught in C++. Some of these classes included data structures and algorithms, intro to computer systems and programming studio. In data structures and algorithms, I had the opportunity to program different data structures and algorithms, such as red/black trees, skip lists, graph traversal algorithms, and shortest path algorithm.<br><br>

      My experience regarding the use of Python is from my personal home projects. I spent the past year creating an application that connects to Texas A&M's bus system to the inquiring student body via text reminder when their bus is a certain number of stops away. I have also utilized Python to create programs to solve difficult problems in my math classes. An example of this was when I wrote a program to calculate the greatest common divisor by using the <a href="https://www.khanacademy.org/computing/computer-science/cryptography/modarithmetic/a/the-euclidean-algorithm" target = "_blank">Euclidean algorithm</a> for my cryptography class.<br><br>

      I have used Verilog in my electrical engineering classâ€™s digital system design and computer architecture projects. In the digital system design, I built small digital circuits and analyzed the output. While in my computer architecture class, I built simple CPUs and memories.<br><br>

      I have used MATLAB, primarily for the first-year engineering courses. During my freshman courses, I took my personal interest in a gaming app <a href="https://www.zynga.com/games/words-with-friends-2/" target = "_blank">(Words With Friends 2)</a> as an opportunity to develop my skillset. After realizing that it would be helpful to search the possible words with my current letters, I wrote a program in MATLAB to aid me in the game. I would enter the letters I had, the length restrictions on my word, as well as a few other parameters to narrow down the search and my program would output the possible words I could play. Since I had written this program during my first year in college, there were multiple inefficiencies that could be improved. After my class on data structures and algorithms class, I rewrote the program and increased the speed 10 fold. <br><br>
