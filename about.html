      <h3>About Me</h3>
      <p> 
        I am the product of a Kentucky hillbilly and a Punjabi pindu (type of Indian villager). My name Skyelar Singh Head was chosen through <a href="https://www.allaboutsikhs.com/sikh-ceremonies/the-sikh-ceremonies-birth-and-naming" target = "_blank">a special Sikh ceremony</a> where our manuscript is opened to a random page, and the name of the child has to start with the first letter of that page. The word was gagan which means sky so as a compromise between my mom's Indian culture and my dad's American culture I was named Skyelar. I was born in Illinois, moved to Kentucky where I spent 7 years, then moved to Seattle for 5 years and have been in Austin for the past 5 years.  I really love outdoorsy activities like rock climbing, mountain biking, and skiing.  I did my first triathlon a couple years ago.  Iâ€™m honored to be enrolled in <strong>electrical computer engineering at Texas A&M</strong>.  I really enjoy building things from scratch such as computers, electric skateboards and other products that make everyday life easier.  I enjoy the reward of using things that I have built. <br><br>
