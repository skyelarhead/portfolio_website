      <h1>Electric Skateboard</h1>
      <p>
      There are 3 notable features that separates this electric skateboard from  commercial ones. First, I have used hobby grade lithium polymer cells, these cells have a much higher discharge rating than the typical 18650 style cells typically used. <a href="https://learn.sparkfun.com/tutorials/battery-technologies/all" target = "_blank">Here</a> is a small description of the different battery chemistries and the pros and cons they have. Second, I have added a battery monitor in the front so that I always know how much farther I will be able to travel on a single charge. Third, I wired in 2 battery management systems. These systems ensure that the lithium polymer cells are balance chaged.<br><br></p>
